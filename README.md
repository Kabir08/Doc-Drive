Since this web app requires the Google Drive API, which has restricted scope, the standard authentication process may not work. I need additional verification from Google to publish the app. That's why I have provided screenshots to demonstrate the app's functionality after authentication.
To test the app, please send the email addresses you'd like to use to kabirpotdar7@gmail.com. I can provide those test user accounts to access the app.
